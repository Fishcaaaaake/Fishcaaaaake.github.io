I'm Lubna Altayeb, a mathematics student at [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/) with a particular interest in combinatorics and graph theory.

Since 2021, I've cultivated a passion for Tech through competitive programming, software development hackathons, and CTFs. 

I have also worked on collaborative projects with a number of my friends in game development, automative programming in robotics, and other areas.

My professional journey started in 2022, interning for bloom (YC 2021) currently rebranded to [elevate](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/elevate). Since then I have worked as a contractor for [Savannah Innovation Labs](https://savannah.sd/), a python development freelancer, and most recently joined [Atacana Group](https://atacana.com/) as a contractor in the Data Engineering Team.


Currently, my efforts are mostly directed towards growing as a mathematician. 

I will begin an independent study on Combinatorial Design Theory with Professor [Emine Sule Yazici](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/eyazici/) in my third semester at Koc University.

        But who am I?

        In reality, I just enjoy chasing the thrill and rush behind learning, thinking, and growing and testing ideas and hypotheticals. I thrive for mathematics, since it never bores me, and always unfolds a new challenge. In a true absurd fashion, quoting Camus, "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy." Perhaps these two sentences best reflect my current relationship with mathematics.
        <br>
        I am 80% luck and 20% human matter :D

In any account, it is unsatisfactory and hardly rewarding for me to seek answers to the question of "I" and "self" (not that I expect to have an answer, nor expect you to expect such a thing from me), so I can relate to the disappointment of the two answers above.
